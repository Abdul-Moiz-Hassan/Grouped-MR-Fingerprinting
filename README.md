# Grouped Pattern Matching MR Fingerprinting C++
This repository is the official implementation of [GPU Accelerated Grouped Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting using Clustering Techniques](https://www.ismrm.org/21/program-files/D-93.htm).

## Requirements
- Visual Studio (or any other compiler/IDE)
- Complex Gouped Dictionary (for grouping dicationary seperate MATLAB code was used)
- Complex Acuired Signals (row major format in .txt files)

## Displaying Resultant Images:
- The resultant images are stored in .txt file.
- `dislpay_images_txt.m` should be executed on MATLAB in order to display images and compute SNR.

P.S: Please raise an issue in this repository, if you need any help or face any issue.
